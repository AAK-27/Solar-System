# Solar-System
### A 3D visualization of the solar system built in JavaScript using Three.js with data from NASA's Horizon and Small Body Databases.
The sizes and distances between planets are not to scale-- This is just because the solar system is massive, and it would take hours to traverse if it was to scale

## Controls
- WASD to move forward, left, back, and right, respectively
- E & Q to rotate the camera clockwise and counterclockwise
- R to ascend and F to descend
